For the TidyTuesday of 05/09/2023 (@rfordatascience-2023 and @macpherson2023), after looking at the data, I choose to make a Shiny App. First of all, I selected the variables I wanted (the state, p_members, members, sector and year). I started making a two different plots, one for looking the percentage of union members per sector and the other one for looking at the evolution of union members percentage in each state.

After doing that, I use *leaflet* for making an interactive map. Then, I adpted the plots and map so they became functions created and use them for the final result, the *Shiny App*.
