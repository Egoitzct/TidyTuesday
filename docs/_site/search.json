I started making a two different plots, one for looking the percentage of union members per sector and the other one for looking at the evolution of union members percentage in each state.\nAfter doing that, I use leaflet for making an interactive map. Then, I adpted the plots and map so they became functions created and use them for the final result, the Shiny App.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nMacpherson, D. A., & Hirsch, B. T.
